This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data(birthwt, package="MASS")
birthwt
```

```{r}
# Turn indicator variables into labelled factors
birthwt$low <- factor(birthwt$low, labels = c("Above 2.5kgs", "Below 2.5kgs"))
birthwt$race <- factor(birthwt$race, labels = c("White", "Black", "Other"))
birthwt$smoke <- factor(birthwt$smoke, labels = c("Non-smoker", "Smoker"))
birthwt$ht <- factor(birthwt$ht, labels = c("No HT", "HT"))
birthwt$ui <- factor(birthwt$ui, labels = c("No UI", "UI"))
```

```{r}
table(birthwt$low)
```



```{r}
birthwt
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
